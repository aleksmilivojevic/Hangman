Doing this for all words, we obtain a set of possible patterns together with multiplicities (For example, \"ex____e\" would also appear when considering the word \"examine\"). Then the entropy $E(l)$ is computed by $$E(l) = \\sum_p -p\\log(p),$$ where $p = \\frac{\\textrm{multiplicity}}{\\textrm{total count}}$ for each resulting pattern.
